Hi, I am Marcy (Liao, Mengxi), an ordinary man, a software engineer and a father. My family and I are living in Vancouver. I previously worked as an engineer in [Clio](https://www.clio.com) and currently working as a a senior developer in [IT Glue](https://www.itglue.com).

I studied Software Engineering and graduated from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University) by 2012, and did my master on Computer Engineering at [University of Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University of Toronto) from 2012 to 2014.

I have a beautiful daughter. Her name is Ivanka.
